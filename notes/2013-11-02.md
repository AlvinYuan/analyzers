*Agenda #1 says "analyzer tasks-MDA model" in case you can't see from the glare.


#Roadblocks:
How do we arithmatically add a float to a datetime?

-Float is alarm length from MDA model

-Datetime pandas object is what we're receiving as data

##Tackling Roadblock: 
Ask Chris and Aaron through Github

##Future problems

What is Tau? And how do we use it in the MDA model?
