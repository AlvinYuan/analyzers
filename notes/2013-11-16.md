### Theory behind Luen model

M0: magnitude we predict

M1: smallest magnitude that will turn alarm on

-Set a level that won't turn on alarm until magnitude passes threshold

           W(M:alpha) = (c1/m1)ku^M if m>m1
           
                      = 0 otherwise

-Vary M1 to sweep across alpha

-Idea is for lower levels of alpha the window is going to be smaller

-u and c1 are two free parameters

### Visualization code

-installed ggplot for plotting in python, can also be used for R

```sudo pip install ggplot```
