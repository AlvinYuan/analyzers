# Meeting notes:

- have suggested functions that would fit our plots
- make pretty plots
- need to bin by magnitude
  - binning is really hard to achieve
- add more years of catalogs
- create a ratio of magnitude/time elapsed multiplied by a contant k (which we need to tune)

#### Binning
- ```numpy.digitize```
  - http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.digitize.html
- ```numpy.arange```
