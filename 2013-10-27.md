  + Break out into groups of 2-5 to work on select parts of the assignment, either across horizontals or amongst the analyzers
  + Be able to define and understand at a high level each of the models, how they differ
  + Understand how to communicate with the other horizontal groups in terms of passing along information
+ Prioritize
  + After Tuesday's class, will have prioritized tasks for each individual
+ S.M.A.R.T goals
