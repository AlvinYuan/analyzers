stat157 analyzers
=========

Horizontal group for [stat157](https://github.com/stat157/) producers (analyzers).

Background
=======

We're trying to predict earthquakes.  There are two models: MDA (Magnitude-Dependent Alarms) and ETAS (Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence).  Learn more about them in the [resources section](https://github.com/stat157/analyzers/tree/master/resources).  We want to improve the simple MDA model to perform better than the complicated ETAS model. This is part of a collaborative term project for UC Berkeley's [stat157 class](https://github.com/stat157/fall-2013).  Poke around the [stat157 repos](https://github.com/stat157?tab=repositories) to see the work done by other groups.

Summary

Highlights
=======

Check out our:

* [Reproducible vagrant box](https://github.com/stat157/analyzers/blob/master/notes/vagrant_setup.md)!
* [MDA skeleton code](https://github.com/stat157/analyzers/blob/master/notebooks/mda_with_curator_data.ipynb) - run it in IPython Notebook using the VM from above
* Progress in [plotting aftershock arrival times](https://github.com/stat157/analyzers/blob/master/notebooks/aftershock_arrival_plots.ipynb) to find a better function for the MDA model
